You can also peek at all the unspent outputs belonging to your currently selected wallet.<br>

<h3>Last Block</h3>
Information about the top most block of the block chain known to your node.

<h3>Network</h3>

Some other data related to your running node.<br>
In this section you can also order the node (its garbage collector engine) to free as much memory as possible.

<h3>Edit configuration</h3>
If you press this button a text area will appear with JSON encoded content of the gocoin client configuration file.
See some help about its content <a href="http://gocoin.pl/gocoin_manual_client_config.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
<br>
Change the values you need an press either <span class="but">Apply</span> or <span class="but">Apply & Save</span>.<br>
If you do not save, the changes will not be permanent and will get undone at the next shut down of the node.<br>
To cancel editing, press the <span class="but">Cancel</span> button reload the page.<br>

<h3>Save configuration</h3>
Whenever you have made any changes to a running node and you want to apply they permanently, press this button to do so.

<h3>Shutting down the node</h3>
Press the <span class="but">Shutdown Node</span> button and confirm to shut down the node.<br>
<span class="note">Note that after the node is off, you will not be able to launch it from the web interface (it will shut down as well).</span>

<hr>
<a name="wal" href=/wal"><h2>Wallet</h2></a>

At this page you can check a balance of each address of you currently selected wallet, as well as quickly switch between all your available wallets.

<h3>Special wallets</h3>
There are three wallets with a fixed name that have a special meaning:
<ul>
<li><b>ADDRESS</b> - this is your address book (the addresses you will be able to select at <a href="snd">MakeTx</a> page)</li>
<li><b>DEFAULT</b> - this is the wallet that is always loaded when the node starts</li>
<li><b>UNUSED</b> - this is wallet where you can move the addresses that you are no longer planing to use (to remove them from your wallets, though still being able to monitor a balance on them, just in case)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Address book</h3>
The address book is a special kind of wallet. You can select it only at this page - when you leave the page, it will switch back to the default wallet.<br>
On the Wallet page you can edit the address book just like any other wallet.

<h3>Editing wallet</h3>
Select a wallet that you wish to edit, end press <span class="but">Edit</span>.<br>
After you are done press <span class="but">Save wallet & Recalc balance</span> button.<br>

<h3>Adding wallets</h3>
To add a new wallet press the <span class="but">Edit</span> button, enter the new wallet's name in
<span class="but">File Name</span> filed, place the desired content of the wallet in the text area
and press the <span class="but">Save wallet & Recalc balance</span> button.

<h3>Deleting wallets</h3>
You cannot delete wallet files from the web interface.
In order to delete a wallet you need to remove the wallet file from the
<span class="cod">wallet/</span> folder (that is a sub-folder in your gocoin's data dir),

<h3>Hidden wallets</h3>
You can have a wallet that won't be visible on the list. Just give it a file name that starts with a dot (.)

<h3>Including wallets</h3>
You can include a content (addressees) of one wallet in another. In order to do this, inside the parent wallet put a line like this:<br>
&nbsp;<span class="cod">@filename</span><br>
<i>(make sure that the @ character is the first one in the line)</i><br>
The wallets you include can be of a hidden type. In fact, including hidden wallets inside parent wallets is their only meaning of their existence.

<hr>
<a name="snd" href="/snd"><h2>MakeTx</h2></a>

Create a transaction to be further signed by gocoin's wallet.<br>
It will also crate a raw transaction, which you can sign by any other wallet (e.g. bitcoin-qt).

<h3>Payment details</h3>
Fill in the outputs of the transaction, the fee and the change address.<br>
If you need more outputs, press the <a>+ add output</a> link.<br>
Note that <i>mBTC</i> values and the value of <b>Change</b> are read-only.<br>

<h3>Estimated tx size</h3>
Note that the estimated transaction size may not be accurate.<br>
It always assumes compressed public keys and 2 of 3 required signatures in case of unknown P2SH input scripts (without corresponding JSON files in wallet/multisig/).

<h3>Select Inputs</h3>
Select the unspent outputs that you want to have in the transaction.<br>
Obviously they must carry enough bitcoins to satisfy your output volume along with the fee - only then <span class="but">Download payment.zip</span> button will be enabled.<br>

<h3>Download payment.zip</h3>
If the button is not enabled, something in the forms is filled in incorrectly.<br>
Otherwise press it to download <b>payment.zip</b>, which you will need to extract at your wallet machine.
Then execute the payment command (by default it will be in file <span class="cod">pay_cmd.txt</span>) and the wallet shall create and sign the transaction, just as you have defined it here.<br>

<hr>
<a name="net" href="/net"><h2>Network</h2></a>

The current network connections to other bitcoin peers.

<h3>Incoming connections</h3>
Click in the link [<a>Switch ON/OFF</a>] (right from the label
<span class="but">Listening for incoming TCP connections</span>)
to switch between allowing or blocking remote connections coming to your node from internet.<br>
<br>
<span class="note">Note that switching on this does not automatically mean that peers will be able to connect to your node.
In most cases you will also need to configure your network gateway to allow incoming connections at the desired TCP port and route them to the host running the node.
Also mind that the recent versions of Satoshi client will not connect to your node on any port other then the default one (that is 8333, or 18333 for testnet).</span><br>
<br>
<span class="note">Note that you need to save configuration at the <a href="/">Home</a> page to make the change permanent.</span><br>

<h3>Peer statistics</h3>
Click on any row in the network connections table to see detailed info about each peer.<br>
The info appears as a text box, below the table.

<h3>Drop a connection</h3>
Click on <img src="webui/del.png"> icon at the right column of a row describing  a peer connection to disconnect from it.


<hr>
<a name="txs" href="/txs"><h2>Transactions</h2></a>

Transactions memory pool, broadcasting and routing control.

<h3>Memory pool</h3>
If the memory pool is disabled the node only operates on the full blocks and never downloads any transactions.<br>
<br>
To enable/disable memory pool click the [<a>Switch ON/OFF</a>] link next to the "Memory pool" label.<br>
<br>
<span class="note">Note that you need to save configuration at the <a href="/">Home</a> page to make the change permanent.</span><br>

<h3>Relay transactions</h3>
Having the memory pool enabled, you can setup your node to either relay incoming transactions, or not.<br>
<br>
Press the [<a>Switch ON/OFF</a>] link right from the label to switch this option on/off.<br>
<br>
<span class="note">Note that you need to save configuration at the <a href="/">Home</a> page to make the change permanent.</span><br>

<h3>Accepted transactions</h3>
The value on the button shows how many transactions are there in the memory pool - click on it to see the list.<br>
Your own transaction (loaded locally) always appear on the top of the list.<br>
The <b>Sent</b> column in the table says to how many times the transaction's data was sent to a peer and (after slash) how many times the inv was sent out.<br>
If the transaction was blocked from being relayed (assuming that the relaying was enabled), the <b>Extras</b> column will show the reason.

<h3>Own transactions</h3>
Locally loaded transactions appear on a light-red background and they have three special icons at the right side of the row.<br>
 &bull; Clicking on <img src="webui/send_once.png"> - orders the node to broadcast a transaction to one random peer (useful for privacy purposes)<br>
 &bull; Clicking on <img src="webui/send.png"> - broadcasts the transaction to all the currently connected peers.<br>
 &bull; Clicking on <img src="webui/del.png"> - removes (unloads) the transaction from the memory pool.<br>


<h3>UTXOs spent in memory</h3>
The number shows how many inputs are currently considered <i>spent</i> by the transactions that have been accepted into the memory pool.
When an input is on this list any new transaction that tries to re-use it will be rejected as a <i>double-spend</i>.

<h3>Rejected transactions</h3>
The value of the button next to the label shows you how many transactions were not accepted into the memory pool.
You will see their list when clicking the button, along with the reason of the rejection.
The node maintains this list to avoid downloading transactions that it had already rejected once.
Transactions are removed from this list either when they get mined into a block or when the node decides to expire them.

<h3>Transactions waiting for inputs</h3>
Here you can check transactions that are waiting for inputs, assuming that you allowed such transaction into memory pool,
which is controlled by configuration parameter <span class="mono">TXPool.AllowMemInputs</span>.

<h3>Transactions being processed</h3>
Number of transaction in the network queue.
These are transactions that are already received from the network (via <b>tx</b> command), but have not been yet processed by the memory pool handler.
In most cases both the number should be equal.
