<h1>Performance tweaks</h1>
On this page you can find ways to improve performance of your running node.<br>
<h2>Faster Elliptic Curve verifications</h2>
You can use external secp256k1 library (written in C and assembler)
which is up to 4 times faster when it comes to EC_Verify operations.<br>
<br>
In order use an external library, copy either the file <b>sipadll.go</b> (Windows only)
or <b>sipasec.go</b> (any OS), from the folder <code>gocoin/client/speedups/</code> to
<code>gocoin/client/</code>.<br>
After doing so, rebuild and restart the client.<br>
<br>
<h3>sipadll.go (Windows only)</h3>
To use <b>sipadll.go</b>, you have to place <b>secp256k1.dll</b>
either in the folder where you launch your client from
or in any other where your Windows looks for executables.<br>
<br>
<i>Note: You can download prebuilt <b>secp256k1.dll</b> from
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/gocoin/files/?source=directory">sourceforge.net</a>
(it's inside <b>secp256k1.dll-amd64.zip</b>).
Or you can just get a non-signed one from <code>gocoin/tools/sipa_dll</code>.</i><br>
<br>
<h3>sipasec.go</h3>
In order to use <b>sipasec.go</b>, you will have to place the files
<b>libsec256k1.a</b> and <b>secp256k1.h</b> where gcc compiler will be able to find them.<br>
<br>
See the top of <code>gocoin/lib/others/cgo/sipasec/sipasec.go</code>
file in case you wanted to specify the paths to them.<br>
<br>
<i>Note:
You have to build <b>libsec256k1.a</b> yourself.
The sources are available through
<a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/">github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin</a>,
but you only have to build <code>src/secp256k1/</code>.</i><br>
