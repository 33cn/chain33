<h2>Coinbase maturity</h2>
According to the block chain protocol, generated coins can be spent only after 100 confirmations.<br>
Users should be aware that fetching a wallet's balance from the client returns&nbsp;also&nbsp;immature coinbase transactions.<br>
If you provide such coins to the gocoin wallet, the network will not mine your signed transaction until the coinbase
inputs that you included in get 100 confirmations.<br>
