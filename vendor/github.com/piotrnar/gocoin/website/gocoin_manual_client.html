<h1>Client node</h1>
Run <code>client -h</code> to see all available command line switches. Some example ones are:
<br>
<br>
<code>-t - use Testnet (instead of regular bitcoin network)<br>
-ul=NN - set maximum upload speed to NN kilobytes per second<br>
-dl=NN - set maximum download speed to NN kilobytes per second<br>
</code>
<br>
<h2>TextUI</h2>
When the client is already running you have an interactive, text command based interface, on the console.<br>
Type <code>help</code> to see the possible commands.
<br>

<h2>WebUI</h2>
There is also a web interface that you can operate with a web browser.<br>
<br>

Make sure that wherever you launch the client executable from, there is the <code>www/</code> folder, along with its content. The folder contains web templates which are an important part of the WebUI application. You can modify these files to satisfy your look&amp;feel preferences,
even to add a new functionality to the web app.<br>
<br>
By default (for security reasons) WebUI is available only from a local host, via <a target="_blank" href="http://127.0.0.1:8833/">http://127.0.0.1:8833/</a><br>
<br>
If you want to have access to it from different computers:<br>
<ul><li>Open <code>gocoin.conf</code> file in a text editor (or edit it at the <b>Home</b> page of the WebUI).</li>
<li>Change <code>Interface</code> value in the config file to <code>:8833</code> (<i>Note: this binds the web service to all network interfaces).</i></li>
<li>Change <code>AllowedIP</code> value to allow access from all the addresses you need - e.g. <code>127.0.0.1,192.168.0.0/16</code> (<i>Note: <code>0.0.0.0/0</code> allows to connect from anywhere).</i></li>
<li>Remember to save the new config and then restart your node.</li></ul>
<br>
Read more about the config file at the <a href="gocoin_manual_client_config.html">Config</a> page.
