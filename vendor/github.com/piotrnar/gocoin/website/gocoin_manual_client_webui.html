<h1>WebUI</h1>
The web interface of the client node (otherwise known as WebUI) is a convenient way to interact with the node from a web browser launched at a local, as well as a remote host.

<br>


<br>
Having the interface loaded into a browser, no matter which sub-page you are at,
you will have access to the main menu.

<br>

<br>
Additional notes:
<br>
<ul><li>By default it is accessible at TCP port <b>8833</b> and the access is restricted to local connection only, so you can access it only from the node's PC using
loading <a target="_blank" href="http://127.0.0.1:8833/">http://127.0.0.1:8833/</a></li>
<li>WebUI is tested with Google Chrome, but should be compatible with any modern HTML5 browser.</li>
</ul>
