## Building from source

Environment requirement: Go (version 1.9 or later)

Debug:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/33cn/chain33.git $GOPATH/src/github.com/33cn/chain33
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/33cn/chain33
make
```

Testingï¼š

```shell
$ make test
```

## Run:


Run single node with below command on your development environment.

```shell
$ chain33 -f chain33.toml
```

### Notices of chain33 plugins
1.Don't use master branch, please use publish branch.<br>
2.Don't re-create vendor dependency, we will support download vender folder for yourself in the future,
but currently not available.

## Contributing to chain33
Below is detailed contribution procedure. This can be skipped and directly see our 
simplified contribution flow in second part.

### 1. detailed procedure
* If you have any suggetions or bug, please create issues and discuss with us.

* Please fork `33cn/chain` to your own branch, like `vipwzw/chain33` via click up right `fork` button.
```
git clone https://github.com/vipwzw/chain33.git $GOPATH/src/github.com/33cn/chain33
```
Notice: Here you will need to clone to $GOPATH/src/github.com/33cn/chain33 or Go-lang package can't find the path.

* Add remote branch `33cn/chain33`: `git remote add upstream https://github.com/33cn/chain33.git. `
We have added `Makefile` to this and command `make addupstream` can be used.

* Synchronize `33cn/chain33` and `vipwzw/chain33 master` branch directly with `make sync`, or below commands:

```
git fetch upstream
git checkout master
git merge upstream/master
```
Notice: don't modify master branch, in this way `master` will in sync with `upstream/master` under any circumstances.
* Create branch from latest `33cn/chain33` 
```
git fetch upstream
git checkout master
git merge upstream/master
git branch -b "fixbug_ci"
```

* Push code to `vipwzw/chain33` 
```
git fetch upstream
git checkout master
git merge upstream/master
git checkout fixbug_ci
git merge master
git push origin fixbug_ci
```
Then coding peers can access your updated code with `pull request` 


### 2. Simplified procedure
#### Preparation
* Please fork `33cn/chain` to your own branch, like `vipwzw/chain33` via click up right `fork` button.
```
git clone https://github.com/vipwzw/chain33.git $GOPATH/src/github.com/33cn/chain33
```
Notice: Here you will need to clone to `$GOPATH/src/github.com/33cn/chain33` ,or Go-lang package can't find the path.

#### Development
* you need to name the branch for yourself
```
make branch b=mydevbranchname
```
#### Complete the development and `Push`
```
make push b=mydevbranchname m="explaining info regarding this push"
```
note: if  `m=` is not set, `git commit` will not execute.

## Modify peer's `pull request`
 Here is an example: <br>
 I am to modify a `pull request` whose `name=libangzhu branch chain33-p2p-listenPort`
 #### step 1: push request need to modify
 ```
 make pull name=libangzhu b=chain33-p2p-listenPort
 ```
Then correct code, and commit on your local machine.
#### step 2: push 
```
make pullpush name=libangzhu b=chain33-p2p-listenPort
```
