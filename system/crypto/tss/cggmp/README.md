# chain33 CGGMP TSS wrapper

This package adds **CGGMP** (Canetti et al., threshold ECDSA) support to
`system/crypto/tss`, in parallel with the existing GG18 wrapper in
`system/crypto/tss/gg18`. It wraps the CGGMP implementation shipped inside
`github.com/getamis/alice` (`crypto/tss/ecdsa/cggmp`) the same way `gg18` wraps
alice's GG18.

`getamis/alice` is a monorepo containing GG18 / CCLST / CGGMP (ECDSA) and FROST
(EdDSA). Upgrading alice to v1.0.7 (a security-fix release) keeps GG18 behaviour
unchanged and makes the CGGMP code available.

## Session / key-material independence from GG18

GG18 and CGGMP sessions never collide:

- protocol tags are disjoint: `/gg18/{dkg,sign,reshare}` vs
  `/cggmp/{dkg,refresh,sign,ppk}`;
- each wrapper has its own private per-process session registry
  (`gg18/session.go` vs `cggmp/session.go`);
- each wrapper registers its own message handlers via `tss.RegisterMsgHandler`.

The shared transport infrastructure is reused as-is: `tss.NewReadyPeerManager`,
`tss.NewListener`, the queue-based `MessageWrapper` fan-out and the per-process
session/message-buffer pattern.

## CGGMP shape vs GG18

alice's CGGMP is not a drop-in replacement for GG18 at the crypto level:

| | GG18 | CGGMP |
|---|---|---|
| after DKG | sign directly | an extra **refresh** is required |
| partial public keys | n/a | exchanged right after DKG (`/cggmp/ppk`) |
| Paillier / Pedersen | fresh Paillier generated in-round per sign | provisioned once by the refresh phase and reused |
| sign threshold | implicit (= signer count) | explicit argument |
| DKG result | `*tss.DKGResult` (proto) | `*DKGResult` (JSON, adds `Rid` + `PartialPubKeys`) |

Therefore the wrapper does **not** hide the phases behind one shared "DKG+sign"
API — that would be a false abstraction. Instead the two packages expose the same
*shapes* and the genuinely common pieces are converged (see below).

## Public API

```
cggmp.ProcessDKG(peers, threshold, rank, sessionID, opts...)  (*DKGResult, error)
cggmp.ProcessRefresh(peers, threshold, dkgRes, sessionID, opts...)  (*RefreshResult, error)
cggmp.ProcessSign(peers, threshold, msg, dkgRes, refreshRes, sessionID, opts...)  (*sign.Result, error)
cggmp.ToBtcecSignature(result)  (*ecdsa.Signature, error)
```

Phase sequence for one key:

```
ProcessDKG            -> persist *DKGResult      (group pubkey + own share + bks + rid + partial pubkeys)
ProcessRefresh        -> persist *RefreshResult  (refreshed share + own Paillier primes + per-peer Pedersen/ppk/y)
ProcessSign (repeat)  -> sign.Result {R,S}       -> ToBtcecSignature
```

`peers` always includes the local node id and must be identical across all nodes
of a phase. `sessionID` must be identical across the nodes of one phase but can
differ between phases. `sign.Result` is alice's type; convert with
`cggmp.ToBtcecSignature`.

## What is unified vs what stays separate (interface decision)

Converged into shared code (single implementation, no duplication):

- **scalar → btcec signature**: `tss.BuildBtcecSignature(R, S)` and
  `tss.BigIntToModNScalar` in `system/crypto/tss/sig.go`. Both
  `gg18.AliceToBtcecSignature` and `cggmp.ToBtcecSignature` delegate to it
  (`gg18/api.go` was refactored, API unchanged).
- **entry-point shapes**: `ProcessDKG(peers, threshold, rank, sessionID)`,
  a `ProcessReshare/ProcessRefresh`, a `ProcessSign`, and a `ToBtcecSignature`
  converter, with `WithTimeout` options — so a caller that learns one package can
  read the other.
- **peer/session/message plumbing** and the **protocol-tag + handler**
  registration pattern.

Kept separate (per algorithm, by design — merging them would be a forced
abstraction):

- **DKG result types**: GG18 `*tss.DKGResult` (proto, in `tss.proto`) vs CGGMP
  `*cggmp.DKGResult` / `*cggmp.RefreshResult` (plain Go, JSON-serialisable).
  CGGMP simply has more key material (rid, partial pub keys, Paillier primes,
  Pedersen params) that GG18 never needs.
- **sign signature**: GG18 `ProcessSign(peers, msg, dkg, session)` vs CGGMP
  `ProcessSign(peers, threshold, msg, dkg, refresh, session)` — the extra
  `threshold` and `refresh` args are inherent to alice's CGGMP.
- **phase count**: GG18 `DKG -> Sign`; CGGMP `DKG(+ppk) -> Refresh -> Sign`.

### How a caller switches GG18 ↔ CGGMP

The change surface for a caller (e.g. the plugin `tss.go`) is limited to:

1. import `cggmp` instead of `gg18` (or both, and branch);
2. DKG: same 4-arg call, but persist the returned `*cggmp.DKGResult`;
3. add one `cggmp.ProcessRefresh` call after DKG and persist its `RefreshResult`;
4. sign: `cggmp.ProcessSign(signers, threshold, msg, dkgResult, refreshResult,
   session)` instead of `gg18.ProcessSign(signers, msg, dkgResult, session)`;
5. convert the result with `cggmp.ToBtcecSignature` (same idea as
   `gg18.AliceToBtcecSignature`).

The group public key (`dkgResult.PubX/PubY`) and the resulting btcec signature
are in the same format as GG18, so address derivation and signature verification
downstream are unchanged.

## Notes / caveats

- **`rank` is the Birkhoff rank, not a node index.** `ProcessDKG`'s `rank` argument is
  the rank of the *local* node's Birkhoff parameter (the derivative order of the shared
  polynomial evaluated at its x-coordinate), **not** a 0/1/2/3 participant number:

  - alice requires `rank + 1 < threshold` (`utils.EnsureRank`), i.e. `rank ∈ [0, threshold-2]`;
  - several participants may share the same rank — they are told apart by their
    (random) x-coordinate, so a valid set for a threshold-`t` sign is any set of
    participants whose sorted ranks satisfy `rank_i <= i` for `i = 0..t-1`
    (`tss.GetValidPeerCombination` picks one);
  - the p2p integration test uses exactly that: 4 nodes with ranks `{0, 1, 1, 1}` and
    threshold 3 for DKG/refresh, then the 3-node subset `{0, 1, 1}` for signing.

  So a plain counter `0,1,2,3` cannot be used for 4 nodes: the highest ranks are
  rejected outright (`rank+1 < threshold`, with `threshold <= 4` here), and the same
  constraint is what leaves rank-0 participants mandatory in a signer subset — the
  most common mistake when switching a caller from GG18, where the equivalent
  parameters are indexed differently.
- **ppk attribution is by authenticated peer id.** `PartialPublicKey.Sender` is
  attacker-controlled and is never used to attribute or validate a partial public key:
  collected points are keyed by `MessageWrapper.PeerID`, the peer id authenticated by the
  transport (`p2p/dht/protocol/tss` fills it from `stream.Conn().RemotePeer()`). A mismatch
  between `Sender` and the authenticated id is logged and otherwise ignored, so one peer
  can neither satisfy the quorum alone nor overwrite another participant's `g^{share}`.
- **The ppk exchange is verified against the DKG group public key.** Once all partial
  public keys are collected, `ProcessDKG` (and `ProcessRefresh` on the persisted material)
  reconstructs the group public key from them through the Birkhoff parameters
  (`birkhoffinterpolation.BkParameters.ValidatePublicKey`, the same check alice runs at the
  end of DKG/refresh). A participant that broadcast a bad `g^{share_i}` is rejected at the
  ppk stage with a `ppk check` error instead of failing later inside the refresh rounds.
  alice's DKG discards its Feldman commitments, so this reconstruction is the only local
  check available at that point.
- **Per-phase timeouts.** The default phase timeout is 30s for DKG, ppk and sign, but
  5 minutes for refresh: refresh generates a fresh 2048-bit Paillier key (safe primes) on
  every node, which alone takes ~23s for 4 nodes on localhost. `WithTimeout` overrides the
  default for all phases (a non-positive value means no timeout).
- **ssid must be session-shared.** The refresh/sign ZK challenges are derived via
  `cggmp.ComputeZKSsid(ssid, peerBk, N)` on both prover and verifier, which only
  match when `ssid` is identical across participants. `cggmp.computeSSID`
  therefore binds the *shared* session id and the DKG `rid` (alice's own cggmp
  tests likewise pass a single shared nonce). Do not derive ssid from the local
  peer's own Birkhoff parameter.
- **Threshold signing with a subset**: pass the actual signer subset as `peers` and the
  matching threshold; `len(peers)` must equal `threshold` (enforced by `ProcessSign` —
  pick exactly `threshold` signers, e.g. with `tss.GetValidPeerCombination`). Only those
  participants' bks / partial pub keys / Pedersen params are fed to alice (the sign core
  iterates the passed maps, so non-participant entries would break the Birkhoff
  coefficient computation).
- The full GG18/CGGMP multi-process run is exercised by the p2p integration tests
  (`gg18_integration_test.go`). This package's `e2e_test.go` runs the complete
  DKG → ppk → refresh → sign crypto in-process (three parties) and round-trips
  every persisted result through JSON, proving the data flow and that the
  signature verifies against the DKG group key.
